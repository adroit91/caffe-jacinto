# Sparse, Quantized CNNs
Train sparse and quantized CNN models. Generate models with arbitrary amount of sprasity that you choose. CNN implementations that can support sparse convolutions will get a ermarkable speedup. Quantize CNN models so that it can use 8 bit integer arithmetic.  

## Training
#### Classification
Train a sparse, quantized CNN for classification (cifar10 dataset is used as an example)
[classification](classification/README.md)  

#### Segmentation
Train a sprase, quantized CNN for semantic segmentation
[segmentation](segmentation/README.md)
